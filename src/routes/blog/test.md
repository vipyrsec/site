# Hello Hello

This is definitely a thing.

[rust](https://rust-lang.org) is a pretty cool language, I'd recommend checking it out.
it's _blazingly fast_ and _memory safe_ so that code always works every where all the time 100%

```rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World");
}
```

is peak code tbh
